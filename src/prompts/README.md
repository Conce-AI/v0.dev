# Prompt Engineering Best Practices for Coding

When crafting prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate or assist with code, consider the following best practices to ensure high-quality and relevant outputs:

## 1. Clear and Specific Instructions
Provide unambiguous and detailed instructions. Avoid vague language. For example, instead of "write code for a chatbot," specify "write a Python Flask application for a customer service chatbot that integrates with a PostgreSQL database."

## 2. Define Role and Persona
Assign a clear role or persona to the LLM. This helps the model generate responses from a specific perspective.
**Example:** "You are an expert Senior Software Engineer specializing in secure backend development. Write..."

## 3. Structured Output
Specify the desired output format. This is crucial for code generation to ensure the output is directly usable.
**Examples:**
- "Provide the code in a single Markdown code block."
- "Structure the response as follows: 1. `FileName.ts` (Code), 2. `FileName.test.ts` (Unit Tests)"
- "Output a JSON object with fields: `filePath`, `codeContent`, `dependencies`."

## 4. Few-Shot Prompting (Examples)
Include concrete examples of desired input-output pairs. This guides the model in understanding the pattern, style, and constraints you expect. Even one or two examples can significantly improve results.
**Example:**
```
// Input: Function to sum two numbers
// Output:
// ```typescript
// function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
//   return a + b;
// }
// ```
```

## 5. Add Constraints and Context
Define limitations, requirements, and relevant context. This helps the model stay within scope and generate more accurate, real-world applicable code.
**Examples:**
- **Constraints:** "Budget: $500, Development time: 2 days, Must use React 18 and TypeScript."
- **Context:** "The existing codebase uses Redux for state management. Integrate the new component with the existing Redux store."
- "Ensure the code handles errors gracefully and includes appropriate error logging."

## 6. Break Down Complex Tasks (Chain of Thought)
For multi-faceted coding tasks, break them into smaller, sequential steps. You can instruct the LLM to think step-by-step or provide a detailed breakdown of the development process.
**Example:**
"Please follow these steps:
1.  Design the API endpoint for user registration.
2.  Implement the database schema for user profiles.
3.  Write the server-side validation logic.
4.  Develop a client-side form for registration."

## 7. Avoid Negations (Use Positive Instructions)
Instead of telling the LLM what *not* to do, tell it what *to* do. Negative constraints can sometimes confuse the model or draw attention to the undesired behavior.
**Example:**
- ❌ Bad: "Do not use `var` in the JavaScript code."
- ✅ Good: "Always use `const` and `let` for variable declarations."

## 8. Iterate and Refine
Prompt engineering is an iterative process. Experiment with different phrasing, adjust parameters (like temperature), and refine your instructions based on the model's output.

## 9. Specify Programming Language and Libraries
Explicitly state the programming language, framework, and specific libraries or versions you want the code to be written in.
**Example:** "Write a Next.js 14 component using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for a user profile card."

By following these practices, you can significantly improve the quality and relevance of code generated by LLMs, making them more effective tools in your development workflow.
